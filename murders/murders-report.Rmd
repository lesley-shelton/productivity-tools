```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

NOTES:
Top Section (anything between the dashes) is called the Header
- output parameter: can change to "pdf_document" or "word_document"

R Chunks:
Where you write your code
- create new chunks with key binding Command-Option-i


```{r}
summary(pressure) # assumes murders dataset
```

When you compile the document, the R code inside these chunks will be evaluated and the result included in that position in the final document.

The applies to plots as well.

Code will show up by default. If want to hide, add "echo=FALSE" in the r curly brackets.
This would make the plot, but won't show the code.

```{r}
plot(pressure) # assumes murders dataset
```

Recommendation: add a label to R code, helpful when debugging. 

Add descriptive words like this:

```{r pressure summary}
summary(pressure)
```

If want to grab the sample R Markdown file for class,
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rairizarry/murders/master/report.Rmd
Can use this doc to trying knitr::knit()

Saved sample murders R Markdown file.

Not only can you create an HTML, PDF, or Word document, but also "github_document"
- produces documents that render on GitHub (file suffix: .md)

You can actually got to that GitHub and click on file.md and you can view in GitHub!!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
